                comparison to celebrating the joy of success. This great entrepreneur who has established
                 Microsoft like the biggest software company is a dropout student from Harvard. Furthermore,
                  he has also been known for his self-owned business figure known as    Traf-O-Data which was 
                  one of the biggest failures in history. The entire investment of Bill Gates got vanished and 
                  unfortunately, even the education could also not get completed. But, the keen desire and the 
                  passion for the computer programming based stuff led him to establish such biggest software 
                  company with the brand name <mark>‘Microsoft’</mark>.
